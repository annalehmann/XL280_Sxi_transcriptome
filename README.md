Homeodomain protein Sxi1α independently controls cell-cell fusion and gene expression during sexual reproduction
in *Cryptococcus deneoformans*. *bioRxiv* 2025. https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.02.11.637763. \
\
It includes steps to: \
  • Mask α and **a** *MAT* loci in the concetenated XL280 α/**a** genome assembly. \
  • Trim and align RNA-seq reads. \
  • Quantify feature abundances from aligned reads. \
  • Identify differentially expressed genes. \
  • Generate the graphics in Figure 5 and Supplemental Figure 1.
